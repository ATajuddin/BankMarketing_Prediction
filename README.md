Problem Statement
There has been a revenue decline for the Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, we found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing effort on such clients.

About Dataset
It is a dataset that describing Portugal bank marketing campaigns results.Conducted campaigns were based mostly on direct phone calls, offering bank client to place a term deposit. If after all marking afforts client had agreed to place deposit - target variable marked 'yes', otherwise 'no'

About Project
In this project, I will analyze the Bank lead's dataset and create a classification algorithm with full end feature engineering and EDA

Project Summary:
I'm a Data Analyst of XYZ consultancy Ltd. The ABC Portugal Bank approached our service and requested us to create a classfication algorithm to automatically place their prospective leads on having a term deposit in their bank. We will be creating a classification algorithm and also suggest them the insights we derive from this dataset and also help them to narrow down their leads into marketing funnel and in the end make a term deposit.

Objectives of project:
Meet and Greet Data
Prepare the Data for consumption (Feature Engineering and Selection)
Perform Exploratory Analysis (Visualizations)
Model the Data using Machine Learning
Validate and implement data model
Optimize and Strategize
